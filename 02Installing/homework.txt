Exercises:

2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install", or compiled methods?
Package: Package manager does nost of the maintenance and checks for compatibility issues. Usually 
makes uprading much easier.  Tar-ball -- MySQL's tarball are hevaily tested, optimized, and 
more up to date than packages from Linux distros. They need a smarter admin than a package to
install.  Compiled -- you can customize exactly what is needed or not needed 
(no need for Slovinien character sets or collation, do not build them).

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?
Compare the md5 hashes

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
